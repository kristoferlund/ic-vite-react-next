## Features

### Backend

The Rust based backend exposes one endpoint only, the `greet` function that returns a greeting message.

### Frontend

The React/Vite/TS based frontend allows the user to input a name and click a button to fetch the greeting message from the backend.

Dependencies:

- [React 19](https://react.dev): The long awaited upgrade brings form actions, optimistic UI updates while mutating, etc etc.
- [Vite 6](https://vite.dev/): The most significant major release since Vite 2, featuring a new Environment API for enhanced flexibility, extended framework support, and streamlined performance for modern web development.
- [Tailwind 4](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/v4-beta): The new version of Tailwind CSS is a ground-up rewrite of the framework, providing faster builds, great new CSS classes and better performance.
- [Tanstack Query 5](https://tanstack.com/query/latest): The template uses Tanstack Query for data fetching, caching and loading state management.
- [Tanstack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest): Modern and scalable routing for React and Solid applications
- [SWC](https://swc.rs/): The Rust based compiler and bundler that provides up to 70x faster build times than Babel.
- [Eslint 9](https://eslint.org/): The latest release of Eslint introduces the flat configuration API along with new rules and bug fixes.
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/): Yes, shadcn support for Tailwind 4 is finally here!
